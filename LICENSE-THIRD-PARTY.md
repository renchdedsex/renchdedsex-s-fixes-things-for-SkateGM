| `exporter/convert.py`, `exporter/build.ps1` | adapted from [2010 Rust Rewrite Mashup](https://github.com/chasmlol/2010-rust-rewrite-mashup) `skate/converter` | Apache-2.0 |
| `engine/` | [2010 Rust Rewrite Mashup](https://github.com/chasmlol/2010-rust-rewrite-mashup) `skate/` (`Cargo.toml`, `crates/`), commit `65d9e117`; its crates from [SK8-ENGINE/skate-3-rust-engine](https://github.com/SK8-ENGINE/skate-3-rust-engine) `cb79689`. Changed by us (marked `gm_sk8 addition`; `engine/CHANGES.patch`) | Apache-2.0 (`engine/LICENSE`, `engine/NOTICE-mashup`) |
| `harness/win/luajit.exe`, `harness/win/lua51.dll` | [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org) | MIT |

The engine's source is in `engine/`; the built module (the DLL) is not kept
in the repository, only in release archives, which carry `engine/LICENSE` and
`engine/NOTICE-mashup` with it. No Electronic Arts code or data is included
anywhere: the engine and the exporter read the player's own game files.
